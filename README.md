## Introduction
This project is a personal website developed using Nuxt 3, created as a way for me to learn and practice front-end development. As a hobby project, it serves as a platform to showcase my work, share knowledge, and explore modern web development technologies. The goal is to experiment with different tools, frameworks, and design patterns while building a fully functional and responsive website.

Through this project, I'm honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js, as well as learning about performance optimization, SEO, and user experience design.
